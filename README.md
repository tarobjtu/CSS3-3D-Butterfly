Browser Support
=================
  - Chrome

I'm sorry, It just suit for the webkit browsers Chrome and Safari.

Because CSS3 perspective Property just realized by  Chrome and Safari.

I used that to achieve an effect that when far away from the screen the butterfly is small, on the contray the butterfly is big.
